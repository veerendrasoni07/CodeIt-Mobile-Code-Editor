🚀 Code Editor App

A lightweight, modern code editor application built for developers who want to write, run, and manage code efficiently without unnecessary bloat.
This app focuses on speed, clarity, and developer-centric features, not gimmicks.

📌 Why This App Exists (Straight Talk)

Most beginner code editors are either:

Too basic to be useful, or

Overloaded with features that slow everything down

This app sits in the middle:

Clean UI

Practical features

Built to learn, practice, and build — not just type code

✨ Core Features

🧠 Multi-language code editing

🎨 Syntax highlighting

📂 File creation & management

▶️ Code execution support (where applicable)

💾 Auto-save & manual save

🌙 Light & Dark mode

⌨️ Developer-friendly keyboard interactions

📱 Responsive layout (mobile & desktop friendly)

🚫 No ads, no distractions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Kept intentionally simple and scalable.

Frontend: Flutter

Backend: Node.js (if execution or storage is involved)

State Management: Riverpod

Database: MongoDB / Local Storage (based on feature usage)

Code Execution: Secure sandboxed execution (Docker-based or isolated process)

🧪 Supported Languages (Current)

Python

Java

JavaScript

C / C++ (basic support)

More languages will be added only if they add real value — no useless checkboxes.

🔐 Security Notes

Code execution (if enabled) runs in isolated environments

No direct system access

No user data is exposed or sold

This is a developer tool, not a surveillance app.

🚧 Known Limitations (Being Honest)

Not meant to replace VS Code or IntelliJ

Heavy projects are not supported

Best suited for:

Learning

Practice

Quick experiments

Interviews & coding prep

If you expect a full IDE — this is not it.

🗺️ Roadmap

Planned improvements (only meaningful ones):

 Integrated debugger

 GitHub repository sync

 Plugin system

 AI-assisted code explanation (optional, offline-focused)

 Project templates

🤝 Contributing
