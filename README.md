# 🚀 Code Editor App

A lightweight, fast, and distraction-free **code editor application** built for developers who want to write, edit, and experiment with code efficiently.  
This app prioritizes **clarity, performance, and real developer needs** over unnecessary features.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most code editors fall into two categories:
- Too basic to be useful  
- Too complex for learning and quick experimentation  

This app is built to sit in the middle — **practical, focused, and efficient**.

Best suited for:
- Learning programming  
- Practicing algorithms and concepts  
- Quick coding sessions  
- Interviews & prep work  

This is **not** a replacement for heavy IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ — and it’s not trying to be.

## ✨ Features

- ✍️ Clean code editor interface  
- 🎨 Syntax highlighting  
- 📁 File creation & management  
- ▶️ Code execution support (where enabled)  
- 💾 Auto-save & manual save  
- 🌙 Light / Dark mode  
- ⌨️ Keyboard-friendly workflow  
- 📱 Responsive UI (mobile & desktop)  
- 🚫 No ads, no clutter, no nonsense

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **State Management:** Riverpod  
- **Backend:** Node.js (if execution or storage is enabled)

## 🧪 Supported Languages

Currently supported:

More languages will be added only if they **add real value**, not for padding the feature list.
