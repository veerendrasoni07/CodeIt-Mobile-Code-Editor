🚀 Code Editor App

A lightweight, modern code editor application built for developers who want to write, run, and manage code efficiently without unnecessary bloat.
This app focuses on speed, clarity, and developer-centric features, not gimmicks.

📌 Why This App Exists (Straight Talk)

Most beginner code editors are either:

Too basic to be useful, or

Overloaded with features that slow everything down

This app sits in the middle:

Clean UI

Practical features

Built to learn, practice, and build — not just type code

✨ Core Features

🧠 Multi-language code editing

🎨 Syntax highlighting

📂 File creation & management

▶️ Code execution support (where applicable)

💾 Auto-save & manual save

🌙 Light & Dark mode

⌨️ Developer-friendly keyboard interactions

📱 Responsive layout (mobile & desktop friendly)

🚫 No ads, no distractions

🛠️ Tech Stack

Kept intentionally simple and scalable.

Frontend: Flutter

Backend: Node.js (if execution or storage is involved)

State Management: Riverpod

Database: MongoDB / Local Storage (based on feature usage)

Code Execution: Secure sandboxed execution (Docker-based or isolated process)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-editor-app.git

2️⃣ Navigate to the Project
cd code-editor-app

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
flutter pub get

4️⃣ Run the App
flutter run

🧪 Supported Languages (Current)

Python

Java

JavaScript

C / C++ (basic support)

More languages will be added only if they add real value — no useless checkboxes.

🔐 Security Notes

Code execution (if enabled) runs in isolated environments

No direct system access

No user data is exposed or sold

This is a developer tool, not a surveillance app.

🚧 Known Limitations (Being Honest)

Not meant to replace VS Code or IntelliJ

Heavy projects are not supported

Best suited for:

Learning

Practice

Quick experiments

Interviews & coding prep

If you expect a full IDE — this is not it.

🗺️ Roadmap

Planned improvements (only meaningful ones):

 Integrated debugger

 GitHub repository sync

 Plugin system

 AI-assisted code explanation (optional, offline-focused)

 Project templates

🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they improve quality, not just add noise.

Fork the repo

Create a feature branch

Write clean, readable code

Open a pull request with a clear explanation

Low-effort PRs will be rejected.

Built with the intention to learn deeply and build seriously, not just push another GitHub repo.

If you want:

a more aggressive startup-style README,

or a clean open-source community version,

or a resume-optimized README,

say the word — I’ll rewrite it better, not longer.

give me read me file in such a way that i can directly paste it to the git hub

Below is a clean, paste-ready README.md.
No explanations. No placeholders like “lorem ipsum”. You can copy-paste this directly into GitHub.

# 🚀 Code Editor App

A lightweight, fast, and distraction-free **code editor application** built for developers who want to write, edit, and experiment with code efficiently.  
This app prioritizes **clarity, performance, and real developer needs** over unnecessary features.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most code editors fall into two categories:
- Too basic to be useful  
- Too complex for learning and quick experimentation  

This app is built to sit in the middle — **practical, focused, and efficient**.

Best suited for:
- Learning programming  
- Practicing algorithms and concepts  
- Quick coding sessions  
- Interviews & prep work  

This is **not** a replacement for heavy IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ — and it’s not trying to be.

## ✨ Features

- ✍️ Clean code editor interface  
- 🎨 Syntax highlighting  
- 📁 File creation & management  
- ▶️ Code execution support (where enabled)  
- 💾 Auto-save & manual save  
- 🌙 Light / Dark mode  
- ⌨️ Keyboard-friendly workflow  
- 📱 Responsive UI (mobile & desktop)  
- 🚫 No ads, no clutter, no nonsense

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **State Management:** Riverpod  
- **Backend:** Node.js (if execution or storage is enabled)  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Local Storage  
- **Code Execution:** Isolated & sandboxed environment (Docker / isolated process)

---

## 🧪 Supported Languages

Currently supported:
- Python  
- Java  
- JavaScript  
- C / C++ (basic support)

More languages will be added only if they **add real value**, not for padding the feature list.

No plugin ecosystem (yet)

If you want a full IDE, this is the wrong tool.

🛣 Roadmap

Planned improvements:

 Integrated debugger

 GitHub repository sync

 Project templates

 Optional AI-based code explanation

 Better execution environment support

Only useful features will be added.
